Detailed Instructions for prefix calculation:

The calculator works by reading the expression from right to left, adding
each number it encounters to a stack, once an operator has been found, the
first 2 numbers of the stack are popped and operated according to the sign.
The result is then placed on top of the stack to be treated like a number again.
This goes on until there is only one remaining number in the stack, which is then displayed as the result.
